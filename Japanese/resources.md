# Learning Japanese
## What to do?

There are several ways to learn japanese, but what I'm curretly doing are scouting through internet to find the methods or mechanics in order to find the way sucessfully using it in real world practices.

Also, in order to master any language including Japanese you have to make a high commitment for yourself because without that, most likely you will not be able to using the language as a daily driver (spek harian in bahasa). High level of commitment will help you out tackle your slowdown and always giving you a hope to keep on trying and trying.

## My custom Hiragana and Katakana order version

While I do several practices directly using paper and pen <a href="/Japanese/histories/writing/">here</a>. I think the current order don't match to be able to be remembered in my brain. With that I'm invented this order to make my brain thinks this is easy to be memorized.
