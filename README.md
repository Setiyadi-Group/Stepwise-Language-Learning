# Stepwise-Language-Learning

<p align="justify">
This repository contains the writing types that has no good format writing on it. I mean
focusing on checkpoints to reach the desired goals rather than making it more
explainable like another repositories.

Always remember that take my words as a reference. You can learn from everyone but,
the formula that works for you is that you have to practice or simulate 
by handful time of up and down and gaining experience on that Language you've learning.

When you committed to do that and start by writing on your own, that's the sign
that you are making your own path to success.
